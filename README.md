## 🤖 AI Execution Pipeline

From these existing codebases, the Python datasets, and the established baseline benchmark, an extension task was initiated. The goal was to build a unified, multi-language tractography loading and saving benchmark suite comparing the **TRX (Tractography eXchange)** format against legacy formats (**TRK**, **TCK**, and **VTK**) under various configurations (coordinate precisions, indexing, and metadata structures).

This task was delegated to **Gemini**. Utilizing the Antigravity-CLI alongside the Conductor plugin (Gemini 3.5 Pro), various subagents (Gemini 3.5 Flash) were dispatched to achieve the following:

* **Codebase Mapping:** Analyze and map the provided source repositories.
* **Environment Setup:** Configure the required environments for Python, C++, Rust, and JavaScript.
* **Compilation:** Build the respective environments across all four languages.
* **Benchmark Replication:** Mimic the established Python benchmark logic across the C++, Rust, and JavaScript implementations.
* **Validation:** Perform tests and dry-run validations to ensure parity.
* **Orchestration:** Write wrapper scripts to automate the build, benchmark, and reporting processes.
* **Documentation:** Draft the foundational documentation for the benchmark suite.

> **Note on Verification:** All code generated, results obtained, and reports compiled by the AI pipeline were (or will be) verified by the developer in charge of each respective language implementation.

## 📖 Scientific Context & Rationale

Tractography reconstructions of human brains routinely generate datasets containing millions of 3D curves representing white matter fiber pathways (referred to as **streamlines**).

Legacy neuroimaging formats suffer from substantial limitations:

* **TRK (TrackVis)**: A rigid binary format consisting of a fixed 1000-byte header followed by sequential float32 streamline points. It lacks compression, has no support for custom coordinate precisions, and cannot store per-streamline or per-point metadata without changing the file structure.
* **TCK (MRtrix)**: A text header followed by a sequence of binary float32 point coordinates. Streamlines are separated by `NaN` value triplets rather than length indicators. While faster to read than text, the lack of an offset index makes random access impossible and sequential loading slower than memory-mapped arrays.
* **VTK**: General-purpose mesh/polydata format. Because it is designed for arbitrary computer graphics meshes rather than fiber tracts, parsing cell connections adds significant overhead. Modern VTK XML files (`.vtp`) use cell offsets of size `num_cells + 1` (a fence-post representation), adding offset alignment complexity, while legacy `.vtk` files rely on sequential point counting.

### The TRX Solution

The **TRX** format (designed as a hierarchical binary folder structure or zipped archive) addresses these shortcomings:

1. **Memory-Mapping (`mmap`)**: Instead of parsing files sequentially and loading them entirely into memory, TRX maps the raw binary arrays (geometry `positions` and streamline `offsets`) directly into the process's virtual address space.
2. **Configurable Precision**: Coordinate data can be stored in `float16` (half precision), `float32`, or `float64`. Index offsets can be `uint32` or `uint64`. Using `float16` coordinates cuts geometry file sizes in half (e.g., from 4.8 GB down to 2.4 GB) with negligible anatomical precision loss.
3. **Flexible Metadata**: Stores arbitrary per-streamline, per-point, and folder-level metadata in independent array files without rewriting streamline geometry.

This benchmark rigorously evaluates the performance gains achieved by TRX's memory-mapped layout compared to traditional sequential file parsing.

## ⚙️ Benchmark Protocol & Design

To ensure scientific rigor and parity across all languages, the benchmarking modules follow a strict measurement protocol:

1. **Single Dataset Directory**: All language runners look for input datasets in the folder specified by the `TRX_BENCHMARK_DATA_DIR` environment variable.
2. **1 Cold Run + 10 Warm Runs**:
* **Cold Run (Iteration 0)**: Incurs initial disk I/O, dynamic linking, and runtime startup/interpreter overhead. Timed, but excluded from summary statistics.
* **Warm Runs (Iterations 1-10)**: Measured sequentially. Timed and included in the final mean and standard deviation calculations.


3. **Programmatic Cache Eviction**: To prevent memory page caching from skewing results, runners invalidate the file system page cache for the target file before every iteration using the POSIX system call `posix_fadvise(..., POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)`.
4. **Programmatic Heap Cleaning**: Memory is explicitly freed and heap spaces are trimmed (e.g., via `malloc_trim` or garbage collection calls) between files and iterations to prevent memory accumulation and thrashing from affecting consecutive runs.
5. **Integrity Parity Checks**: Every single file loader performs dynamic integrity checking. The first successfully loaded file establishes the baseline streamline and total point count. All subsequent loaders and formats must perfectly match this baseline configuration, allowing the suite to automatically scale from small validation datasets to massive production volumes (e.g., **5,979,093** streamlines). Any mismatch invalidates the timing and records an error.

## 💻 Language-Specific Implementations

Each language track has been engineered to optimize performance while adhering to the uniform benchmark protocol.

### 🐍 Python

The Python track utilizes the official scientific libraries in the neuroimaging ecosystem.

* **Libraries & Dependencies**:
* `numpy`: Array manipulation.
* `trx-python`: Core library for TRX memory-mapping and I/O.
* `nibabel`: Standard library for reading TRK and TCK files.
* `dipy`: Used for streamline processing utilities.
* `fury`: Used for loading and saving VTK polydata formats.


* **Memory Management**:
Triggers explicit Python garbage collection (`gc.collect()`) followed by a ctypes call to `libc.so.6`'s `malloc_trim(0)`. This forces the glibc memory allocator to release freed heap memory back to the operating system, preventing CPython memory fragmentation.
* **Cache Eviction**:
Uses Python's native `os.posix_fadvise(fd, 0, size, os.POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)` after opening file descriptors to flush OS read caches.
* **Write Operations**:
Measures save operations for all formats (TRX, TRK, TCK, VTK).

### 🦀 Rust

The Rust track leverages the safety and raw performance of native compiled binaries.

* **Libraries & Dependencies**:
* `trx-rs` (linked via local workspace path `../../trx-rs`): High-performance Rust parser for TRX.
* `libc`: Binds POSIX functions for disk cache flushing.
* `serde` & `serde_json`: High-speed JSON serialization.


* **Optimization**:
Built using Cargo release optimization flags (`cargo build --release`).
* **Memory Management**:
Relies on Rust's compile-time RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization). Objects are dropped immediately when they go out of scope. We enforce thread sleeps (`std::thread::sleep`) between iterations to allow the kernel allocator to settle.
* **Cache Eviction**:
Uses native C bindings via the `libc` crate: `libc::posix_fadvise(fd, 0, 0, libc::POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)`.
* **Write Capability**:
Supports writing all formats (TRX, TRK, TCK, VTK). A custom, highly optimized TrackVis (.trk) reader and writer was implemented in `rust/src/utils.rs` to bypass the `trx-rs` library's strict loading checks and intentional omission of the TRK writer.

### ⚡ C++

The C++ track represents the high-performance compiled baseline, built under strict compiler optimization.

* **Libraries & Dependencies**:
* `trx-cpp` (linked via CMake path `../../trx-cpp`): Static C++ TRX library.
* `Eigen`: Header-only linear algebra library.
* `libzip`: Used internally for reading/writing ZIP compressed TRX archives.


* **Optimization**:
Compiled using CMake in `Release` mode with maximum optimizations (`-O3`).
* **Custom Legacy Format Parsers**:
To avoid the enormous overhead of standard mesh structures, a lightweight, highly optimized binary parser was implemented in `cpp/utils.cpp`.
* *TCK/TRK/VTK*: Coordinates are counted by scanning binary data chunks directly from a file buffer rather than copying them into Eigen dynamic matrices, allowing high-performance parsing that serves as a baseline for the physics/geometry level.


* **Memory Management**:
Utilizes smart pointers and custom scopes for RAII. Calls `malloc_trim(0)` between runs to release memory pages.
* **Cache Eviction**:
Uses standard `<fcntl.h>` system calls to get a raw file descriptor and call `posix_fadvise(fd, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)`.
* **Write Capability**:
Supports writing all formats (TRX, TRK, TCK, VTK). Highly optimized C++ encoders for TCK, TRK, and VTK are implemented in `cpp/utils.cpp` utilizing low-overhead binary chunk buffering.

### 🌐 JavaScript (Node.js)

The JavaScript track evaluates the performance of the V8 JavaScript engine running under Node.js. Processing multi-gigabyte files in JS presents several engine-level challenges, which were solved using custom workarounds.

* **Libraries & Dependencies**:
* `trx-javascript` (linked locally): Core JS TRX reader.
* `fflate`: Extremely fast, pure JS zipping library.
* `fzstd`: Zstd decompression.
* `gl-matrix`: High-speed vector operations.


* **Technical Workarounds & Engine Bypasses**:
1. **Node.js 2 GiB File Limit**: Node's default `fs.readFileSync` throws a `RangeError [ERR_FS_FILE_TOO_LARGE]` when attempting to load files exceeding 2 GiB. We implemented a custom chunked binary reader in `js/utils.js` using `fs.openSync` and `fs.readSync` in a loop, pre-allocating a single large `ArrayBuffer` to bypass this V8 boundary.
2. **Shared ArrayBuffer Corruption**: Libraries like `fflate.unzipSync` decompress files into a shared backing `ArrayBuffer` to avoid memory copies. Instantiating typed arrays natively reads from the start of the shared buffer instead of the decompression slice, causing coordinate/offset corruption. We resolved this by implementing a `getAlignedArray` helper that safely maps bounds using `data.byteOffset` and `data.byteLength`, while enforcing strict byte-alignment boundaries.
3. **TRK Memory Duplication Wall**: Reading legacy `.trk` files historically sliced the underlying header buffer to create the payload array (`buffer.slice()`). On multi-gigabyte datasets, this instantly violated V8's heap constraints by duplicating the entire file in RAM. We patched `readTRK` to map directly onto the existing buffer using `new Int32Array(buffer, offset)`.
4.  **V8 Heap Memory Configuration**: Large datasets cause Node.js processes to exceed the default heap limit (1.4 GB) and crash with out-of-memory (OOM) errors. The benchmark runner must be invoked with `--max-old-space-size=16384` to expand the heap limit to 16 GB.
5.  **Garbage Collection**: Node is run with the `--expose-gc` flag. Programmatic memory reclamation is triggered before each run using `global.gc()`.
*   **Write Capability**:
Supports writing all formats (TRX, TRK, TCK, VTK) using high-performance chunked encoders in `js/utils.js`. The TRX format is serialized directly to a zip-based archive using `fflate.zipSync`.

## 📊 Uniform JSON Schema

To ensure identical parsing structures, every runner output writes to `results/<language>_results.json` conforming to this exact layout:

```json
{
  "language": "python",
  "data_directory": "/home/local/USHERBROOKE/rhef1902/Libraries/trx/trx_benchmark_04_2026",
  "results": {
    "loading": {
      "f16_ui32_w_metadata.trx": [0.3842, 0.3541, 0.3129, 0.3012, 0.3204, 0.3341, 0.2981, 0.3120, 0.3042, 0.3114],
      "f32_w_metadata.trk": [3.4921, 3.2014, 3.1142, 3.0921, 3.0114, 3.1204, 2.9921, 3.0421, 3.0019, 3.1092]
    },
    "saving": {
      "f16_ui32_w_metadata.trx": [0.6841, 0.6542, 0.6014, 0.6120, 0.5982, 0.6042, 0.5891, 0.6112, 0.6021, 0.5998]
    }
  }
}

```

## 🔧 Setup & Installation (Language-by-Language)

This section provides step-by-step instructions to compile and prepare each benchmark module individually.

### 🐍 Python Setup

The Python module requires Python 3.8+ along with several scientific neuroimaging libraries.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended to avoid package conflicts):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

```
2.  **Install PIP Dependencies**:
    First install standard pre-requisite libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy nibabel dipy fury
```

3. **Install the Local `trx-python` Library**:
Since we are benchmarking the local implementation, install it in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e ../trx-python
```
*Alternatively, install all from the requirements file:*
```bash
pip install -r python/requirements.txt
```

### 🦀 Rust Setup

The Rust module relies on the Cargo build system and the Rust compiler (`rustc`).

1. **Ensure Rust is installed** (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)):
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version

```
2.  **Compilation**:
The Rust track links dynamically to `trx-rs` at the relative sibling path `../../trx-rs`. Compiling with release flags is critical to enable compiler optimizations:
```bash
cd rust
cargo build --release

```
The compiled binary will be placed relative to the workspace at `target/release/trx-nature-2026-benchmark-rust`.


### ⚡ C++ Setup

The C++ benchmark runner compiles using CMake and links to the local `trx-cpp` sibling library.

1. **System Requirements**:
Ensure you have `cmake` (version 3.16+), a C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., `g++` 9+), and `libzip-dev` installed (for ZIP file parsing support).
On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libzip-dev

```
2.  **Configuration & Build**:
Create a build directory, run CMake in Release mode, and build in parallel:
```bash
cd cpp
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

The compiled binary will be created at `cpp/build/trx_benchmark`.


### 🌐 JavaScript (Node.js) Setup

The JavaScript track requires Node.js (version 16 or newer) and the Node Package Manager (`npm`).

1. **Ensure Node.js and NPM are installed**:
```bash
node --version
npm --version

```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
Initialize dependencies (`fflate`, `fzstd`, and `gl-matrix`) in the `js` sub-folder:
```bash
cd js
npm install
```

---

## 🏃 How to Run the Benchmarks

You can run the benchmarks either using the **Master Orchestration Pipeline** (automatic building, running, and reporting) or **Individually** per language.

### Environment Variable Setup

Before running any benchmark, you **MUST** export the environment variable `TRX_BENCHMARK_DATA_DIR` pointing to the folder containing the target tractography datasets:

```bash
export TRX_BENCHMARK_DATA_DIR="/path/to/trx_benchmark_04_2026"

```

### Option A: Master Orchestrator Pipeline (Recommended)

The orchestration scripts compile all targets, run the benchmark cycles, and generate the final results table.

1. **Run Everything (Build, Run, & Report)**:
```bash
./run_benchmarks.sh

```
This triggers:
- Compilation of C++ in Release mode.
- Compilation of Rust in Release mode.
- JS dependency installation.
- Full sequential benchmark execution of Python, Rust, JavaScript, and C++.
- Aggregation of results into `results/summary.md`.

2.  **Targeted Pipeline Commands**:
*   **Build Only**: Compile Rust and C++ runners and set up Node packages.
```bash
./run_benchmarks.sh build

```

*   **Run Only**: Execute the benchmark runs (assuming they are already compiled).
```bash
./run_benchmarks.sh run

```
*   **Report Only**: Regenerate the Markdown comparison summary table from existing `results/*.json` files.
```bash
./run_benchmarks.sh report

```

*   **Clean Build**: Remove all compiled artifacts, cache directories, and generated `results/` JSONs to start fresh.
```bash
./run_benchmarks.sh clean

```

### Option B: Running Languages Individually

If you want to debug or isolate execution to a single language track, run the scripts directly from the repository root:

* **Python**:
```bash
python3 python/benchmark.py
```

*   **Rust**:
```bash
./rust/target/release/trx-nature-2026-benchmark-rust
```

* **C++**:
```bash
./cpp/build/trx_benchmark

```

*   **JavaScript**:
*CRITICAL: You must pass the `--expose-gc` flag (to allow programmatic garbage collection) and expand heap space using `--max-old-space-size=16384` to prevent Out Of Memory (OOM) crashes on large files.*
```bash
node --expose-gc --max-old-space-size=16384 js/benchmark.mjs

```

After running individual modules, their outputs will be saved to `results/<language>_results.json`. You can then consolidate them into the final report by running:

```bash
python3 orchestrate.py report

```
